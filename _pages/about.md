# **Sanket Biswas**

## Hello and welcome!

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Chemical Engineering](#) at the [University of California, Berkeley](#), co-advised by [Prof. Kranthi Mandadapu](#) and [Prof. Karthik Shekhar](#). My research uses theoretical and computational modeling to study the spatiotemporal transport of ions—and the resulting electrochemical signals—across cellular lipid membranes. These signals may be driven by localized ionic fluxes through ion channels and pumps, or by externally applied electric fields. This work aims to advance fundamental understanding of membrane bioelectricity and may ultimately help inform improved treatments for disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathies, and other channelopathies.

Previously, I completed my M.A.Sc. in [Chemical and Biological Engineering](#) at the [University of British Columbia (Vancouver)](#), co-advised by [Prof. John Frostad](#) and [Prof. Gwynn Elfring](#). My thesis focused on analytical and numerical modeling of the dynamics of Newtonian and viscoelastic microdroplets under quasi-static and oscillatory deformation between two substrates, with the goal of extracting interfacial tension and bulk rheology from measured force responses using the Cantilevered Capillary Force Apparatus (CCFA).

My research interests lie at the intersection of continuum mechanics, transport processes, and applied mathematics. I’m always happy to connect about research in these areas—or to chat with students considering similar paths.
